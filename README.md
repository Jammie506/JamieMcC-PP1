## Love Swimming!

Love Swimming is a website that aims to provide a smooth and friendly way for people to start swimming, improve their skills or just make new friends. The site will be primarily targeted towards adults living and working in and around Dublin City Centre. The site will allow users to join tailor-made classes to begin lessons or to improve their fitness and swimming abilities.

The site will also allow users to set up their own “Community Meets”, allowing for the growth of the community into more specialized training sections for all abilities and styles. Love Swimming will also be useful for swimmers to progress their skills in the water to their desired level, whether this would be to join a more competitive team to compete in races or simply to feel more confident in the water on holidays.


## Features

* Navigation Bar
    * In place at the top of all pages, this allows users to easily navigate the entire site without the need to use external controls, such as the browser “Previous Page” or “Back” button.
    * The simplistic design of the Navigation Bar clearly outlines all that is available for visitors to the site, both on Mobile and Desktop.
    * The Navigation Bar has been designed to automatically hide using CSS on smaller screens, to be replaced with a menu icon, in order to prevent visual overcrowding.

* Home Page
    * The home page includes a large “Hero Image” that draws the user’s attention, encouraging them to remain on the site.
    * The use of bright colours also served to catch the user’s attention by creating a visually appealing page.
    * On large screens the page is laid out in such a way that users can see some of the content below the hero image, encouraging them to scroll to read it. This can increase the amount of time that the user remains on the site.

* Benefits of Swimming
    * This section outlines some of the reasons that users may be interested in joining the club.
    * The various and wide-ranging information should help to encourage a wider audience of people to become interested in the club.

* Meet Ups & Community Meets
    * This page allows users to see what option they have for attending a club meet for a specific purpose, such as for general training or as a way to attend more focused training.
    * The “Community Meets” section allows users to explore training sessions created by members of the wider Love Swimming community.
    * The “Community Meets” section allows users to explore training sessions created by members of the wider Love Swimming community.

* Social Media Section
    * On each page, located in the footer of each page allows users to find the club in alternate places outside If the primary website. This can help encourage them to incorporate the club into their social life, increasing attendance.
    * As the links to social media are pinned to the bottom of each page, they remain unobtrusive yet easily accessible for all site users.

* Gallery 
    * Page contains images of past club events to give new and existing members a chance to see what the club is about and what they have been involved in previously.
    * This page has value as it allows viewers to see what the team organises and establish if it is something that they would be interested in overall.

## Features to be Implemented

* Competitions Page
    * The competitions page will collate any local or regional competitions into a single location for simmers, this will allow them to easily see all upcoming competitions. 
    * This page will specifically work as a directory for all upcoming events, linking users out to external pages while also providing information on how to enter the competitions as part of the Love Swimming team.

## Testing

* A majority of the testing for this website was conducted using the Responsive Screen Size tool within Google Chrome’s dev mode. This allowed me to ensure that the design elements all worked across different simulated screen sizes. This also allowed for stress testing of the site by rapidly changing the size of the screen.
* The site was deployed via GitHub Pages to ensure that there were no issues that occurred between the initial development stage and the full launch of the page. Some issues were encountered during this phase and were thus resolved.
* The site was tested across multiple devices, including an iPhone 12 Pro Max and a Samsung device. The latter of these revealed an issue with the Community Meet form where the form itself overflowed the backing image. This issue was then was then resolved by matching the maximum height of the form to the height of the image.
* An issue was found in testing where the Community Event button did not scale in the same method as the rest of the meetups. This issue was resolved by adding the “Flex Grow” property to all links within the “times” class on the page. This also ensures that any further buttons that need to be added to the page will match the existing styling be default.

## Credits
